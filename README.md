## Project Title:
Monsters Rolodex

Description:
The Monster Catalog is a project that allows users to view a list of monsters and their basic information. Monsters are displayed in cards, each containing the monster's name and other relevant details. Users can scroll down to see more monsters and can interact with the application to filter or search for specific monsters.

Key Features:
Displaying Monsters in Cards: Monsters are displayed in individual cards, each containing the monster's name and other information such as type, abilities, etc.

Infinite Scrolling: The application supports infinite scrolling so that users can see more monsters as they scroll down the page.

Filtering and Searching: Users have the ability to filter monsters based on different criteria such as type, rarity, etc. Additionally, they can search for specific monsters using a search bar.

Componentization with React Classes: The project is built using the class-based approach in React to create reusable and well-structured components.

Technologies Used:
React
JavaScript (ES6+)
HTML5
CSS3
Monster API (optional, if there's an API to fetch monster information)
Workflow:
When the application is loaded, it displays an initial list of monsters in cards.

Users can scroll down to see more monsters. As they scroll, more monsters are loaded automatically.

Users have the option to filter monsters based on different criteria such as type, rarity, etc. They can also search for specific monsters by typing into the search bar.

When users click on a monster card, they may be directed to a monster details page where they can view more information about that specific monster.

Component Structure:
App: Main component that renders the application.
CardList: Component that renders the list of monster cards.
Card: Component representing an individual monster card.
FilterBar: Component that displays filtering and search controls.
MonsterDetails: Component that displays complete details of a specific monster (optional).
Final Considerations:
The Monster Catalog project offers an interactive experience to users, allowing them to explore a variety of monsters easily and conveniently. With the ability to filter and search monsters, users can quickly find the information they're looking for. Additionally, the well-defined component structure and the use of classes in React ensure that the code is organized, modular, and easy to maintain.
